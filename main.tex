\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}                       % if you are not using xelatex ou lualatex, replace by the encoding you are using
%\usepackage{CJKutf8}                              % if you need to use CJK to typeset your resume in Chinese, Japanese or Korean

% adjust the page margins
\usepackage[scale=.9]{geometry}
%\setlength{\hintscolumnwidth}{3cm}                % if you want to change the width of the column with the dates
%\setlength{\makecvtitlenamewidth}{10cm}           % for the 'classic' style, if you want to force the width allocated to your name and avoid line breaks. be careful though, the length is normally calculated to avoid any overlap with your personal info; use this at your own typographical risks...

\section{Experience}
\subsection{Vocational}
\cventry{Summer 2020}{Software Engineer Intern}{Quickbooks Integration \& Automation}{Intuit}{Mountain View, CA}{
  Worked on improving Quickbooks automation through integrating models into the frontend codebase,
  as well as improving UX and quickfixing bugs.
}
\cventry{Fall 2018 \& Fall 2019}{Teaching Assistant}{Intro to Computing Systems}
{University of Pennsylvania}{}{Provided office hours for students to help them
 grasp theoretical ideas behind the computer system from transistors to assembly
  language to C and maintaining the stack and heap memory. }
\cventry{July 2019-- Sept. 2019}{Research Assistant}{University of Pennsylvania}
{}{}{Tested the performance of different models, including CORELS,
 sklearn-expertsys, DTExtract, and various blackbox models on a number of public
  datasets.}
\cventry{May 2019-- July 2019}{Engineering Research Intern}{National University
 of Singapore}{Singapore}{}{Researched machine learning models and their 
 accuracy for localizing sensor nodes in an indoor wireless sensor network for
  a mobile life sign monitor medical device. More about the research project,
  \textbf{Localization of Sensor Nodes}, is mentioned below.}
\cventry{June 2018-- Sept. 2018}{Front End App Developer Intern}{Teamtrics}
{Philadelphia}{}{Learned and executed conceptual front end frameworks of an
 Android app and single handedly developed the Front End in the native language 
 of Java via Android Studio. }

\subsection{Projects}
\cventry{}{PennOS}{Operating Systems}{University of Pennsylvania}{}
{Worked with a team to develop an operating system with a proper scheduler, file system and shell.
Worked on the file systems, but also integrating the file systems with the scheduler and shell.
Developed skills in cooperation with a team on an extensive project built in C as well as 
understandable code for the API of the file systems.}
\cventry{}{Autograder}{Intro to Computing Systems}{University of Pennsylvania}{}
{Worked with a team of developers in Python on the autograding software for 
programming assignments done in C that will be used and updated for years to 
come.}
\cventry{}{Compiler}{Intro to Computing Systems}{University of Pennsylvania}{}
{A Compiler written in C, that takes a stack based programming language called J,
 and compiles it into Assembly for the LC4 }
\cventry{}{Penn-Shell}{Operating Systems}{University of Pennsylvania}{}{Worked with a partner to create
a shell similar to bash written in C using various system calls to implement 
job handling, foreground and background processes, multi-stage pipelining, and redirection}
\cventry{}{Kinitro}{Software Design \& Engineering}{University of Pennsylvania}{}{
    Worked with a group to full-stack develop a mobile app for Android using Android Studio for 
    frontend and Node.js as our backend. Later on translated the front end to build it on 
    React Native for interest of learning. }
\cventry{}{Localization of Sensor Nodes}{Mobile Life Signs Monitor}{National University of Singapore}{}{
  Collected data and curated it to train multiple models to test the 
  performance of Neural Networks, SVMs, and Multiple Linear Regression
  using sklearn-expertsys and TensorFlow in python to localize sensor nodes
  within an indoor low energy bluetooth sensor network.
